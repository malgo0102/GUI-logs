Log viewer and visualizer
Read log files in xml and csv format-like, represent them in GUI and include statistics, max and min value, analyze several files at once. Include search engine. For exam the project could include data visualization and more advanced statistics.

I used Tkinter standard GUI package (it is built into standard Python library) and Pandas. Log files are provided in folder "logs".

To install Pandas:
pip install pandas
